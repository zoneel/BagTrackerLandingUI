# Bag Tracker Landing UI
## Introducing Bag Tracker, a desktop application designed to help sneaker resellers track their spendings and earnings. 


### With Bag Tracker, resellers can keep a record of their purchase price, sale price, and fees associated with each transaction. The app also calculates profits and losses, providing users with a clear view of their financial performance.

Built using C# and designed with XAML, Bag Tracker offers a great opportunity for users to learn and explore this popular technology while expanding their portfolio. So if you're a sneaker reseller looking to streamline your finances, or a developer looking to add a new project to your portfolio, try out Bag Tracker today!




> Bag Tracker is not intended to be a working software for commercial
> use. Instead, it was created as a learning project to raise my C# and
> WPF skills to another level.
